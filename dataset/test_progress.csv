"I think the best day of my life, while I believe I've had many, probably is the day that I first landed in Italy for my trip. I landed in Rome and I was very overwhelmed and I was kind of suffering for some jet lag but I was so happy to be there and it was so fun getting to soak up all the new sites and smells and sounds and seeing all the people there that looked different than I did. And the first thing we did was go to the Colosseum and just being able to see that with my own eyes in person as opposed to on a computer screen or TV screen was just amazing. Just getting to experience all the new food as well, that was just as fun. I absolutely loved it and I wish I could relive that feeling.",156,24,31,12,3.5576923076923075

The kids are running around. It's full of games. Everyone is trying to play hide and seek or other games between children, especially. I think this school playground made me realize that I would never be a good kindergarten teacher because I wouldn't have enough patience to deal with the cows that I see every day. I do admire actually more teachers because they have to see that every day as well. The games that I see are ball games, football, or just like I said, hide and seek games.
